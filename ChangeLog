	* z-java/j2sdk-bin: clean-up, fixed bugs #7183, #7139.
	* REJECTED_MSG: moved the sorcery lib rejected message here for
	  better control. I am the only one using it so can be removed 
	  from sorcery as often need to customize for individual spells.
	  Note that I have moved from 'return 1' for errors to 'exit' as
	  currently sourcery is not honoring our rejected responses.
