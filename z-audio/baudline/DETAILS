Baudline is a time-frequency browser designed for scientific visualization of
the spectral domain. Signal analysis is performed by Fourier, correlation,
and raster transforms that create colorful spectrograms with vibrant
detail. Conduct test and measurement experiments with the built in
function generator, or play back audio files with a multitude of effects and
filters. The baudline signal analyzer combines fast digital signal processing,
versatile high speed displays, and continuous capture tools for hunting down
and studying elusive signal characteristics.
