Monkey's Audio is a fast and easy way to compress digital music.  Unlike
traditional methods such as mp3, ogg, or lqt that permanently discard quality to
save space, Monkey's Audio only makes perfect, bit-for-bit copies of your music.
That means it always sounds perfect - exactly the same as the original.  Even
though the sound is perfect, it still saves a lot of space. (think of it as a
beefed-up Winzip for your music) The other great thing is that you can always
decompress your Monkey's Audio files back to the exact, original files.  That
way, you'll never have to recopy your CD collection to switch formats, and
you'll always be able to recreate the original music CD if something ever
happens to yours.
