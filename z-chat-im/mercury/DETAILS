Mercury is a Java Based MSN client.
With Mercury you can do the same things as with your normal messenger:
    * Talk to friends
    * Change your nickname and status
    * Add a display picture (also know as avatar)
    * Send files through the msn server (for people with a firewall etc..) or direct
    * Play games (Tic Tac Toe and Connect4 only at the moment)
    * Watch the webcam of your friends (Mercury auto-saves these sessions on the disk and can convert them to Quicktime movies, click here for more info)
    * Allow other people to watch your webcam
    * Video conference is implemented (both sending and receiving) but still a beta feature.
