	* After spending weeks attempting to build OpenOffice, I

	  straight to z-rejected.

2002-05-01 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Applied patches (except for gcc3 related) located at
	  http://www.linux-debian.de/openoffice/, thanks to Yoav
	  Avitzour <avitzour@princeton.edu> for pointing me here.

2002-03-06 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* DETAILS: Modified (finally figured this out ;) to have
	  gpc as SOURCE2, rather than creating a whole other spell
	  for 2 header files that just need to be copied for OpenOffice.
	  Found that if I have an "_" in my SOURCE (and probably any others),
	  I must use the escape sequence "\" before it for it to read
	  (e.g. SOURCE=oo_$VERSION_src.tar.bz2 ->
	  SOURCE=oo\_$VERSION\_src.tar.bz2)
