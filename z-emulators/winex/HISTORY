2003-07-09 Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@flyingtemple.com>
	* Re-wrote the spell again.
	  This should work better along side the
	  normal wine.
	  Now installs to /usr/lib/transgaming/
	  Version bump to 3.1 / CVS Head
	  Support for pulling either the latest
	  release branch or the main branch from
	  cvs
	  Supports more configure options.
	  Added Unattend_Safe ability.
	* TODO:
	  1. Modify the winex-$VERSION/tools/winex shell
	  script more efficently for general usage.
	  2. Attempt to modify libcvs_url to allow MD5s
	  on the release branch (should never change), then
	  add the MD5 for the release branch.

2003-07-06 Jose Bernardo Silva <jbernardo@sourcemage.org>
	* Updated to winex 3-1

2002-11-16 Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@sourcemage.org>
	* Completely rewrote the spell to use sorcery's
	  cvs downloading, and tarring.
	* Removed DEPENDS because having a 'depends cvs' was
	  only necissary when the spell required cvs for
	  downloading. It was done to ensure that people
	  could download winex, since sorcery does this, and
	  sorcery depends one cvs, this is redundancy.

2002-10-25 Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@sourcemage.org>
	* Realized HISTORY File was missing.
	  Fixed a PRE_BUILD bug.
	  Updated the VERSION field to force a rebuild
	  so that it references the updated glibc.

	* Added to the grimoire

2002-04-12 Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@sourcemage.org>
