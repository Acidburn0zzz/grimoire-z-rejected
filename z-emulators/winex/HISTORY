		Re-wrote the spell again.
		This should work better along side the
		normal wine.
		Now installs to /usr/lib/transgaming/
		Version bump to 3.1 / CVS Head
		Support for pulling either the latest
		release branch or the main branch from
		cvs
		Supports more configure options.
		Added Unattend_Safe ability.

		TODO:
		1. Modify the winex-$VERSION/tools/winex shell
		script more efficently for general usage.
		2. Attempt to modify libcvs_url to allow MD5s
		on the release branch (should never change), then
		add the MD5 for the release branch.

		Updated to winex 3-1

2002-11-16  Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@sourcemage.org>

		Completely rewrote the spell to use sorcery's
		cvs downloading, and tarring.

		Removed DEPENDS because having a 'depends cvs' was
		only necissary when the spell required cvs for
		downloading.  It was done to ensure that people
		could download winex, since sorcery does this, and
		sorcery depends one cvs, this is redundancy.

		Realized HISTORY File was missing.
		Fixed a PRE_BUILD bug.
		Updated the VERSION field to force a rebuild
		so that it references the updated glibc.

		Added to the grimoire

2002-04-12  Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@sourcemage.org>
