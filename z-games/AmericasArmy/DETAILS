Nobody knows military simulations like the world's premier land force, the U.S. Army. So when the 
Army began making a simulation to let civilians experience the barracks to the battlefields, it 
sent its talented development teams to experience the Army as a recruit would. The developers 
crawled through obstacle courses, shot weapons, parachute jumped, and visited the Army bases, all 
to let you play Army in the most realistic way ever depicted in a computer game.
