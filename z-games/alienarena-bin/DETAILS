Alien Arena is a free standalone deathmatch game based on source code released
by id Software. Begun by COR Entertainment in 2004, the game combines a
1950s-era sci-fi atmosphere with gameplay similar to the Quake, Doom, and
Unreal Tournament series. Alien Arena focuses mainly on online multiplayer
action, although it does contain single player campaigns against bots.
