caps is the llibrary to access the caps-project images.

The main objective of C.A.P.S. is to guarantee the preservation of such an important part of 
computer gaming history. However due to the number of commercial games released for the Amiga, 
C.A.P.S. relies heavily on the Amiga community's contribution. Please carefully read both the 
introduction section of the site as well as the FAQ for a more in depth explanation of what 
C.A.P.S. is all about, what it's objectives are and it's purpose. Don't hesitate in contacting us 
if, after going through all the documentation present here, you still have questions or would like 
further information.
