Challenge ProMode Arena (CPMA or CPM; unofficially Promode) is a free
modification for id Software's first-person shooter computer game Quake III
Arena (Q3A). CPMA provides a gamemode which includes physics allowing for
air-control, rebalanced weapons, fast weapon switching, improvements of jumping
techniques. It also provides a vanilla (unmodified physics engine) Quake III
(VQ3) support, Multiview GTV and demo technology, enhanced bots AI, new maps,
etc.

Challenge ProMode Arena became the primary competitive mod for Q3A since the
Cyberathlete Professional League announced CPMA as it's basis for competition.
The mod has its own division in Cyberathlete Amateur League, and also has its
own competitions and leagues.

CPMA physics has been implemented in other Q3A notable modifications, DeFRaG
and Orange Smoothie Productions (OSP).
