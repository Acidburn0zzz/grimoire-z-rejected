Crafty is a state-of-the-art  computer  chess  program,  and
uses  all  of  the  search algorithms you have probably read
about, negascout search, killer/history move  ordering,  SEE
(Static  Exchange  Evaluation)  quiescence move ordering and
pruning, hash (transposition/refutation) tables as  well  as
evaluation caches, selective extensions, recursive null-move
search, and a host of other features that have been used and
are  still  being  used in most computer chess programs.
