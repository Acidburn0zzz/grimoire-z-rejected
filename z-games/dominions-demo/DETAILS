Dominions - Priests Prophets & Pretenders is a turn based fantasy game in which
you take the role of a pretending god.
Each pretender is Lord and Master of one of fourteen cultures, each with its
own individual strengths and weaknesses. With the aid of soldiers and mages you
will conquer the lands of your neighbors in a struggle for total domination.
Priests and prophets will preach throughout the world to spread your dominion,
the manifestation of your divine supremacy.
