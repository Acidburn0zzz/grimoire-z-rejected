Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives, or NERO for short, is a unique computer
game that lets you play with adapting intelligent agents hands-on. Evolve
your own robot army by tuning their artificial brains for challenging tasks,
then pit them against your friends' teams in online competitions!

NERO is a result of an academic research project in artificial intelligence,
based on the rtNEAT algorithm. It is also a platform for future research on
intelligent agent technology. The NERO project is run by the Neural Networks
Group of the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at
Austin.
