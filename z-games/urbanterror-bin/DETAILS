Urban Terror can best be described as: "Where Quake meets reality"; it is
realism based to a certain extent (environments/weapons/player models), but
also goes by the motto: "fun over realism" (fast gameplay and lots of action).
This combination of reality and action results in a very unique, enjoyable
and addictive game.
