Warsow is a First-person shooter (FPS) game designed for online play. Many
games, as detailed below, have inspired Warsow, yet it is its own unique game.
Similarities to Quake 3 CPMA and Unreal Tournament series are probably the most
evident. The team has sought to create a fun, fast, action-packed game which
may be seen as a critique of the many realistic, slow, warfare-orientated
First-person-shooters that saturate todays FPS market.

Concept:
  * Standalone game for Windows and Linux under General Public License
  * eSports oriented FPS
  * Gameplay focused on speed, trick jumps and art of move
  * Complete Power-up system, including exclusive weak and strong fire mode
    for each gun
  * Cartoonish graphics, mixing Cyberpunk / Industrial / SciFi themes
