Developed and headed by the professional cartoonist and illustrator ENTE,
PadWorld Entertainment, the Team behind World of Padman (WoP) proudly present
a free multiplayer standalone game for Windows, MacOSX and Linux that's powered
by an extended Quake3-Engine based on the source of ioquake3.

WoP is the domain of ENTE's comic strip super-hero bad-boy Padman and his
motley crew, and their mission is to make your game with some seriously
addictive fun, whatever your skill level, and whatever character role you jump
into.

Over the years maps have been revamped, bot play improved, killer-ducks kept
hungry, weapons repolished, menu's redesigned, and much more, such as new
sounds, skins, secrets, effects, and power-ups! In all, there are 13 maps.
Each supports up to 7 game types, comprising WoP's unique Spray Your Color
Free For All (SYC FFA), Spray Your Color Team Play (SYC TP), Last Pad Standing
(LPS), and of course Big Balloon (BB), as well as those old favourites Death
Match, Team Death Match, and Tourney. Meet scaled-up and richly detailed maps
of everyday places where imaginative characters go berserk with an array of
colourful plastic weaponry and power-ups and start rockin' to the Dieselkopf
soundtrack, and the Pad-Anthem performed by Green Sun; so grab those earphones.
