cat << EOF
Molden is a package for displaying Molecular Density from the Ab Initio 
packages GAMESS-UK , GAMESS-US and GAUSSIAN and the Semi-Empirical packages 
Mopac/Ampac, it also supports a number of other programs via the Molden 
Format. 

Molden reads all the required information from the GAMESS / GAUSSIAN outputfile. 
Molden is capable of displaying Molecular Orbitals, the electron density and the 
Molecular minus Atomic density. Either the spherically averaged atomic density 
or the oriented ground state atomic density can be subtracted for a number of 
standard basis sets. 

Molden supports contour plots, 3-d grid plots with hidden lines and a combination 
of both. It can write a variety of graphics instructions; postscript, XWindows, 
VRML, povray, OpenGL, tekronix4014, hpgl, hp2392 and Figure. The Xwindows version 
of Molden is also capable of importing and displaying of chemx, PDB, and a variety 
of mopac/ampac files and lots of other formats. It also can animate reaction paths 
and molecular vibrations. It can calculate and display the true or Multipole Derived 
Electrostatic Potential and atomic charges can be fitted to the Electrostatic Potential 
calculated on a Connolly surface. Molden has a powerful Z-matrix editor which give 
full control over the geometry and allows you to build molecules from scratch, 
including polypeptides. 

Molden was also submitted to the  QCPE (QCPE619), allthough the Xwindows version is 
considerably running behind on the current one.
