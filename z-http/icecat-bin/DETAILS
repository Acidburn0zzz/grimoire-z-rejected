Gnuzilla is the GNU version of the Mozilla suite, and IceWeasel is the GNU
version of the Firefox browser. Its main advantage is an ethical one: it is
entirely free software. While the source code from the Mozilla project is free
software, the binaries that they release include additional non-free software.
Also, they distribute non-free software as plug-ins. (IceWeasel does keep the
triple licensing used by Firefox to facilitate the reuse of code.)

In addition, IceWeasel includes some privacy protection features:

  1. Some sites refer to zero-size images on other hosts to keep track of
     cookies. When IceWeasel detects this mechanism it blocks cookies from the
     site hosting the zero-length image file. (It is possible to re-enable
     such a site by removing it from the blocked hosts list.)
  2. Other sites rewrite the host name in links redirecting the user to another
     site, mainly to "spy" on clicks. When this behavior is detected, IceWeasel
     shows a message alerting the user.

To see these new features in action, some test pages are available.
