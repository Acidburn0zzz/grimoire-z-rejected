The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver 
production-quality releases of code derived from the application 
formerly known as "Mozilla Application Suite". Whereas the main focus of 
the Mozilla Foundation is on Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird, 
our group of dedicated volunteers works to ensure that you can have 
"everything but the kitchen sink" â€” and have it stable enough for 
corporate use.
