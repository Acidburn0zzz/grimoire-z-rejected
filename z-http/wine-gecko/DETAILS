Some users recreate their .wine often and don't want to have to download gecko
repeatedly, will find this information useful.

MSHTML code looks for cab file in $data_dir/gecko (that is usually
/usr/share/wine/gecko). Alternatively, if you run Wine from build dir, it looks
for $build_dir/../gecko. Wine checks it both in wineprefixcreate and, if Gecko
is not installed, on first usage. It means that if you download wine_gecko from
SourceForge and put it in the right place, you will no longer have to care
about installing Gecko.
