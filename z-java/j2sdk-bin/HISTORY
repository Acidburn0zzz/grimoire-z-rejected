	* WIP: removed, not really applicable for z-rejected as we never
	  move spells into 'stable.'
	* UNATTENDED_SAFE: removed for now, not sure why needed as you need
	  to pull sources by hand anyway for intel.
	* CONFIGURE: uses REJECTED_MSG file and has been updated to include 
	  spell specific warnings about source downloads.
	* FINAL: added to source java.sh for JAVA_HOME to be set.

2004-07-20 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD, INSTALL: converted to build_api 2
	* DETAILS: use the Sun j2sdk since that works with gcc 3.4.x
	* PREPARE, DETAILS, INSTALL: detect architecture and use the
	  j2sdk for that architecture
	  The intel j2sdk has to be downloaded by hand since only suns j2sdk
	  works with gcc 3.4.
	* PRE_BUILD: don't do anything here, everything happens in INSTALL
	* INSTALL, java.sh: set correct bindir on installation
	* WIP: only tested on x86, sparc and ppc need testing

2004-05-09 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: don't link all binaries to /usr/bin, as that overwrites files
	  of gcj and isn't needed (java.sh sets the path)
