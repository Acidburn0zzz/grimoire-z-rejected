Java(tm) Based Constructor of Useful Parsers (CUP for short). CUP is a system
for generating LALR parsers from simple specifications. It serves the same role
as the widely used program YACC [1] and in fact offers most of the features of
YACC. However, CUP is written in Java, uses specifications including embedded
Java code, and produces parsers which are implemented in Java.
