The Java Media Framework API (JMF) enables audio, video and other time-based
media to be added to applications and applets built on Java technology.
This optional package, which can capture, playback, stream, and transcode
multiple media formats, extends the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE)
for multimedia developers by providing a powerful toolkit to develop scalable,
cross-platform technology.
