These are the ATI provided binary XFree86 drivers for their graphics cards.

The ATI Proprietary Linux driver currently supports RADEON 8500 and later AGP
or PCI Express graphics products, as well as FireGL 8700 and later products. We
do not currently plan to include support for any products earlier than this.
Drivers for earlier products should already be available from the DRI Project
or Utah-GLX project.
