	* UNATTEND_SAFE: Safe to reinstall unattended
	* ipw3945d: The /sbin/ipw3945d binary is linked specifically against
	  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 and won't find ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
	  if it's in LD_LIBRARY_PATH somewhere else (e.g. /lib).
	  So, the modprobe.d script will now temporarily create /lib64 -> /lib
	  if there is no /lib64 directory (in case people are using /lib64)
	  while the daemon is started or stopped.

	* PRE_BUILD: Doesn't seem to require CONFIG_NET_RADIO (which I cannot
	  find in my linux-2.6.22/.config anyways)
