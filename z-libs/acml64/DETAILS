ACML provides a free set of thoroughly optimized and threaded math routines for
HPC, scientific, engineering and related compute-intensive applications. ACML
is ideal for weather modeling, computational fluid dynamics, financial
analysis, oil and gas applications and more.

ACML consists of the following main components:

    * A full implementation of Level 1, 2 and 3 Basic Linear Algebra
     Subroutines (BLAS), with key routines optimized for high performance on
     AMD Opteron(tm) processors.
    * A full suite of Linear Algebra (LAPACK) routines. As well as taking
    * advantage of the highly-tuned BLAS kernels, a key set of LAPACK routines
     has been further optimized to achieve considerably higher performance
     than standard LAPACK implementations.
    * A comprehensive suite of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) in both single-,
     double-, single-complex and double-complex data types.
    * Fast scalar, vector, and array math transcendental library routines
     optimized for high performance on AMD Opteron processors.
    * Random Number Generators in both single- and double-precision.
