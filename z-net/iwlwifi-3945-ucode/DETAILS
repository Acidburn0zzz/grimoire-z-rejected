The iwlwifi project provides a driver which utilizes the new mac80211 subsystem
for the Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN and Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG
Network Connection adapters.

In addition to using the new mac80211 subsystem, this project uses a new
microcode image which removes the need for the user space regulatory daemon.
This change should help to simplify installation, development, and
redistribution of this driver package.

NOTE: The iwlwifi driver is a development driver. If you are looking for a
fully validated and stable driver, please visit the Intel Customer Support
download page
