cat << EOF
The EAGLE Layout Editor is an easy to use, yet powerful tool
for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs). The name EAGLE
is an acronym, which stands for Easily Applicable Graphical
Layout Editor.
The program consists of three main modules
* Layout Editor
* Schematic Editor
* Autorouter
which are embedded in a single user interface. Therefore there
is no need for converting netlists between schematics and layouts.
The EAGLE Light Edition can be used for free!
Light version limitations
The following limitations apply to the EAGLE Light Edition in general:
* The useable board area is limited to 100 x 80 mm (4 x 3.2 inches).
* Only two signal layers can be used (Top and Bottom).
* The schematic editor can only create one sheet.
* Support is only available via email or through our forum
* Use is limited to non-profit applications or evaluation purposes.
