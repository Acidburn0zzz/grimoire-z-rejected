Inform is a design system for interactive fiction, a new medium for writers
which began with adventure games in the late 1970s and is now used for
everything from literary narrative fiction through to plotless conceptual
art, and plenty more adventure games too. Since its introduction in 1993,
Inform has become a standard tool.  Three years in the making, Inform 7 is
a radical reinvention of the way interactive fiction is designed, guided
both by contemporary work in semantics and by the practical experience of
some of the world's best-known writers of IF.

An easily learned but flexible one-window user interface makes the cycle
of writing and testing rapid and painless. Inform creates, manages, edits,
indexes, tests, and even helps to publish works of IF without fuss or screen
clutter.  Inform itself is a free download. It produces works playable on a
vast range of computers: distribute these free or for profit with no rights
implications or financial obligations to the author of Inform. Convenient
publishing features include help with drawing maps, producing websites,
cover art, bibliographic data, walkthrough solutions and more.

In place of traditional computer programming, the design is built by writing
natural English-language sentences: *Martha is a woman in the Vineyard.
*The cask is either customs sealed, liable to tax or stolen goods.  *The
prevailing wind is a direction that varies.  *The Old Ice House overlooks
the Garden.  *A container is bursting if the total weight of things in it
is greater than its breaking strain.

Inform's power lie in its ability to describe: to lay down general rules
about "closed doors", or "bursting containers", or "unmarried men liked by
Martha". At its best, expressing IF in natural language results in source
text which is not only quick to write, but very often works first time,
and is exceptionally readable.
