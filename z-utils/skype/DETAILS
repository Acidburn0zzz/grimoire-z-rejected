Skype is free and simple software that will enable you to make free calls
anywhere in the world in minutes. Skype, created by the people who brought you
KaZaA, uses innovative P2P (peer-to-peer) technology to connect you with other
Skype users. If you are tired of paying outrageous fees for telephony, Skype
is for you!

Skype is quick and easy to install. Just download it, register, and within
minutes you can plug in your PC headset and call your friends on Skype. Skype
calls have excellent sound quality and are highly secure with end-to-end
encryption. Best of all, Skype does not require you to reconfigure your
firewall or router (it just works!)
