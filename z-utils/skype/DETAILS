Skype is a little piece of software that lets you make free calls to 
anyone else on Skype, anywhere in the world. And even though the calls 
are free, they are really excellent quality. If you and your friends, 
family or business contacts are using webcams, you can also make free 
video calls. You can even call landlines and mobile phones at really 
cheap per minute rates (and thereâ€™s no setup or subscription fee).
