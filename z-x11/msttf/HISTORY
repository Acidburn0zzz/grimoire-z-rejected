	* this _was_ the truetype spell, but due to Microsoft's
	  pig-headed refusal to understand the meaning of the 
	  word "free"... a completely different file now has to 
	  be downloaded. The original file, available from
	  http://www.keithp.com/~keithp/fonts/
	  now only includes Windows executables.
	  Please note that this spell should now be placed in
	  the "z-rejected" area, as these fonts aren't "free".
