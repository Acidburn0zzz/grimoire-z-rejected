The 'nvidia-settings' utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA
Linux graphics driver.  It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA
X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This
communication is done with the NV-CONTROL X extension.

Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature,
and OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.

When nvidia-settings starts, it reads the current settings from
its configuration file and sends those settings to the X server.
Then, it displays a graphical user interface (GUI) interface for
configuring the current settings.  When nvidia-settings exits, it
queries the current settings from the X server and saves them to
the configuration file.
