NoMachine NX is a fast and scalable terminal server system based on the X11
protocol. NX lets you work fluently even across slow links like modems and
provides a full set of administration tools that make it a complete desktop
virtualization solution for your organization.

This package contains the graphical front-end used to access X, RDP and RFB
sessions on a remote NX Server. It also includes NX X compression libraries
and utilities needed by both NX Client and Server.
